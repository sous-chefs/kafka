# kafka cookbook

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mthssdrbrg/kafka-cookbook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mthssdrbrg/kafka-cookbook)

Installs Kafka `v0.8.1.1`, and probably any newer versions.

Based on the Kafka cookbook released by WebTrends (thanks!), but with a few
notable differences:

* supports both source and binary releases.
* does not depend on runit cookbook.
* does not depend on zookeeper cookbook, thus it will not search for nodes with
  a specific role or such, that is left up to you to decide.
* only tested on Vagrant boxes.
* intended to be used by wrapper cookbooks.

## Requirements

This cookbook does not depend on any specific cookbooks, but it requires that
java is installed on the system, thus the `java` cookbook is recommended.

Ruby 1.9.3+ and Chef 11.6.0+.

### Platform

* Amazon Linux
* CentOS 6.5 and 7
* Debian 7.4
* Fedora 20
* Ubuntu 14.04

Might work on other platforms / versions, but these are the ones that are
included in `.kitchen.yml`, so YMMV.

## Attributes

In order to keep the README in some kind of manageable state (and thus in sync
with attributes), attributes are documented inline (in the `attribute` files
that is).

Attributes concerning configuring of a Kafka broker are to be set under the
`broker` namespace, and one can choose which ever syntax they prefer the most,
the following are all valid ways to define broker configuration:

```ruby
node.default.kafka.broker[:log_dirs] = %w[/tmp/kafka-logs]
node.default.kafka.broker['log.dirs'] = %w[/tmp/kafka-logs]
node.default.kafka.broker.log.dirs = %w[/tmp/kafka-logs]
node.default[:kafka][:broker][:log][:dirs] = %w[/tmp/kafka-logs]
```

A warning regarding the "dotted" notation, it doesn't play very well when
setting attributes like `default.replication.factor` or
`fetch.purgatory.purge.interval.requests` due to fairly obvious reasons
(`default` and `fetch` are also methods).

Refer to the official documentation for the version of Kafka that you're
installing.
Documentation for the latest release can be found [over here](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#brokerconfigs).

## Recipes

This section describes the different recipes that are available.

### default

Includes either `source` or `binary` recipe depending on what
`node.kafka.install_method` is set to (`:source, :binary`).

### source

Downloads, compiles and installs Kafka from the official source releases.
Defaults to installing `v0.8.1.1` of Kafka.

### binary

Downloads and installs Kafka from the official binary releases.
Defaults to installing `v0.8.1.1` of Kafka.
